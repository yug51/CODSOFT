After the films, they release the emotion of the fantasies in the most erotic and uncommon ways. One slips off to the curator's office for a little \"acquisition. \" Another finds the anthropologist to see what bones can be identified. Even the head teacher isn't immune.

            "5 ::: The Unrecovered (2007) ::: drama ::: The film's title refers not only to the un-recovered bodies at ground zero, but also to the state of the nation at large. Set in the hallucinatory period of time between September 11 and Halloween of 2001, The Unrecovered examines the effect of terror on the average mind, the way a state of heightened anxiety and/or alertness can cause the average person to make the sort of imaginative connections that are normally made only by artists and conspiracy theorists-both of whom figure prominently in this film. The Unrecovered explores the way in which irony, empathy, and paranoia relate to one another in the wake of 9/11.\n",

So, with his brother Juan, who is eight years old and is quite disobedient, spend their time committing prank after prank, causing the resulting anger of his mother, the nanny and the old housemaid. The rest of the family members are two much older brothers, his resigned mother and a retrograde father of authoritarian ideas. But many years have passed, and the civil war that won the despot Don Pablo is simply for their children \\\"Dad's war\\\".\",\n          \" Before he was known internationally as a martial arts superstar, Bruce Lee had appeared in a handful of Hong Kong films as a child star in the 1940s/50s. One of these early films was The More the Merrier (1955), a.k.a. We Owe it to Our Children from the Union Film Enterprise, a family melodrama written and directed by renowned filmmaker Chin Chien (My Intimate Partners). Featuring the 14-year-old Bruce Lee and future Cantonese Opera star Yuen Siu Fai, the B&W film revolves around accountant Ming (played by Cheung Wood Yau) and his wife (Tsi Lo Lin) who suffers a miscarriage in an car accident. The couple decides to adopt a baby girl, not knowing that she's the daughter given up by Ming's poor co-worker who struggles to feed a bunch of kids. Bruce Lee plays the slacker son of the landlord (Ko Lo Chuen).\",\n          \" One year in the life of Albin and his family of shepherds in the North of Transylvania.
